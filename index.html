    <h1>Tom Archer</h1>
    <p class="bio">
        Tom Archer is a longtime software developer, author, and technologist with 
        deep roots in Python, C++, Windows programming, and AI-driven automation. Tom
        began his career coding the box office reporting and itinerary systems in Amsterdam for 
        Holiday on Ice. Since then, he has designed and built software for 
        companies like IBM, AT&T, and VeriSign. He currently
        develops AI tools at Microsoft that generate technical documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tom helped build and run <em>CodeGuru.com</em>, once the web’s largest Windows developer 
        community. He has been recognized by Microsoft as a C++ MVP and has written a dozen technical
        books and hundreds of online articles.
    </p>
    <p>
        While very content in his current role at Microsoft, decades of experience have taught 
        Tom that there's always tomorrow to plan for. If you have a cool and 
        interesting project - especially one that blends technology, creativity, and real-world 
        impact - he's always excited to hear about it!
